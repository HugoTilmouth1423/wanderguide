## Ad Creative Variations

### Creative Angle 1: "The Google Problem"
**Hook:** "Stop googling 'things to do near me' every 5 minutes"
**Message:** Position WanderGuide as the solution to constantly switching between apps and searching.

**Ad Copy (Version A - Short):**
```
🗺️ Stop googling. Start exploring.

WanderGuide is like having a local friend in every city.
Just ask "what should I see next?" and go.

✅ Knows your exact location
✅ Photo recognition for any landmark
✅ Walking-distance suggestions
✅ Works anywhere in the world

```

**Ad Copy (Version B - Story):**
```
Last week in Paris, I spent 45 minutes on Google trying to figure out where to eat near the Marais.

Then I tried WanderGuide.

Me: "I'm hungry, anywhere good nearby?"
WanderGuide: "You're 2 minutes from L'As du Fallafel - best falafel in Paris. There's usually a queue but it moves fast. The vegetarian platter is incredible."

That was it. No scrolling through TripAdvisor. No comparing 47 restaurants.

Just asked, got an answer, and had the best lunch of my trip.

```

### Creative Angle 2: "Your Personal Guide"
**Hook:** "What if you had a local expert following you around every city?"
**Message:** Emphasize the personalized, conversational experience.

**Ad Copy (Version A):**
```
🏠 Imagine having a local friend in every city you visit.

Someone who knows:
• Where the tourists DON'T go
• That café with the best coffee
• The story behind that weird statue
• Where to go next based on where you are

WanderGuide gives you exactly that.

Choose your guide (historian, local, storyteller, or more) and just... ask.

"Where should I go next?"
"What's the story with this building?"
"Anywhere good for lunch within 5 mins walk?"

Try 5 questions free. No card needed.
```

### Creative Angle 3: "The Photo Feature"
**Hook:** "Point your camera at anything and learn its story"
**Message:** Lead with the unique photo recognition feature.

**Ad Copy:**
```
📸 Point. Snap. Learn.

See an interesting building? 
Take a photo → WanderGuide tells you its whole story.

Weird statue? Famous landmark? Random street art?

Your AI tour guide identifies it instantly and tells you:
• What it is
• Why it matters  
• The stories most tourists never hear

Plus walking directions to your next stop.

It's like having a knowledgeable friend who never gets tired of your questions.

### Creative Angle 4: "Price Comparison"

**Message:** Position the value against alternatives.

An audio guide rental: £15
